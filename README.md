ABSTRACT

Water is an important resource and not all communities around the world can afford to be liberal with their water needs; it has become important to use available water as efficiently as possible, especially in agriculture. For the purpose of reducing the 
overwatering of crops, an unattended ground moisture sensor can be implemented to measure the current moisture level in the soil surrounding the plants. This will allow a farmer to know when to water/stop watering his crop.  The sensor design consists of a 
Wheatstone bridge for determining the resistance of the soil, followed by a differential amplifier for converting the measured resistance into a voltage. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the case of traditional irrigation system water saving is not considered. Since, the water is irrigated directly in the land, plants under go high stress from variation in soil moisture, therefore plant appearance is reduced.
